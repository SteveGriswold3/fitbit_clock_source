# Fitbit Clockfaces

## Welcome

How does a developer enjoy free time.  Well by programming in another language of course.  I am not a big fan of the https://studio.fitbit.com/ editor.  I opted to pull the fitbit code into VSCode.  Plus I now am using git to save versions.  Developing watch faces leads me into creative trials, which in the end I may just want to scrap.  Using git allows me to rollback to designs that were functioning.

## About Me

### Steve Griswold

I am a Data Scientist by day, and watch face developer by night.  When I saw Fitbit make a developer platform for building apps, I wanted to play.  I saved up to buy a watch for myself and made myself a few clocks.  Now I'm looking to push my skills and sell some.  Please use my code to learn or contribute to help me be a better coder.  However, I do publish these for sale in the fitbit store.  So I will not share the asset resource on git.

- Griswold Lights

### Griswold Lights

With the last name Griswold, I have to love the movies that haunted me as a child.  This Holiday Season I wanted to make a watch face to share for the holiday.  First I was thinking something kind of arcade style.  But then I thought of how does a Griswold do Christmas Lights.  With this inspiration I started building a clock face that uses a few christmas lights.
